!$MADDRESS is a managed version of !address, which attempts to annotate all memory
with information about CLR's heaps.

usage: !$MADDRESS [-stat] [-showImageTable] [-includeReserve] [-useReserveHeuristic]

Flags:
    -stat
        Supresses the list of each individual memory range and only shows the summary
        table (and the image table if requested).

    -showImageTable
        Breaks down the memory ranges consumed by images in the process.
        
    -includeReserve
        Include reserved memory (MEM_RESERVE) in the output.  This is usually only
        useful if there is virtual address exhaustion.

    -useReserveHeuristic
        If this flag is set, then !$MADDRESS will attempt to "blame" reserve segments
        on the region that immediately proceeded it.  For example, if a "Heap"
        memory segment is immediately followed by a MEM_RESERVE region, we will call
        that reserve region HeapReserve.  Note that this is a heuristic and NOT
        intended to be completely accurate.  This can be useful to try to figure out
        what is creating large amount of MEM_RESERVE regions.
